## Overview


HREPNet is trained on ERA5 and CMPA high-resolution precipitation datasets, taking coarse-resolution (0.25Â°) atmospheric variables (temperature, pressure, humidity, geopotential, and wind) as inputs to generate high-resolution precipitation forecasts.

## Model Architecture

![Model Architecture](assets/model_arch.jpg)
Based on the assumption that high-resolution precipitation consists of meso-scale average precipitation and sub-grid scale residual precipitation, HREPNet employs a novel two-component architecture:

1. **Deterministic Model**:
   - Based on 3D SwinTransformer architecture
   - Captures average precipitation at mesoscale resolution


2. **Probabilistic Model**:
   - Employs conditional diffusion in latent space
   - Accounts for uncertainties in residual precipitation at convective scales
   - Generates ensemble members through latent variable sampling

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up and running the project will be added soon. The pre-trained model weights will also be made publicly available.

## Data Sources

- **ERA5 Reanalysis Data**: Global atmospheric reanalysis data
